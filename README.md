The program will take the title of the archive and create a new folder for it, and download all of the images to that folder. It'll repeat for every link you have in URLs.txt.
If there are no links in URLs.txt, it will instantly close and nothing will happen.

# Installation

Make sure python 3.7 or greater is installed

Download a release from https://github.com/Jules-WinnfieldX/CyberDropDownloader/releases
Extract all of the files to a single directory.

# Usage
Copy and paste links into URLs.txt. 
Each link you add has to go on it's own line. (paste link, press enter, repeat).

Double click on Start.bat (or Start.sh for Mac OS/Linux), it will download the needed libraries using PIP and run the program.

NOTE: Mac OS X / Linux users will likely have to run the command "chmod +x Start.sh" before they can execute the script.
